As the language of the Internet browser, JavaScript is ubiquitous and Node.js is an asynchronous, event-driven, JavaScript runtime. Node.js has qualities that can make it particularly useful in various scenarios. From service-mocking, rapid-prototyping and real-time applications to building Command Line Interfaces in a short time to accessing a plethora of ecosystem utilities.
